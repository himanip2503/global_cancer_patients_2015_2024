# 🧬 Cancer Severity & Lifestyle Factors Analysis

This project explores the relationships between *lifestyle behaviors, **genetic risks, and **cancer severity* using a real-world sample dataset. The objective is to uncover patterns that affect treatment cost, survival years, and disease severity—while presenting these insights in a *clean Tableau dashboard* and through *in-depth Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA)*.

## 📌 Project Description

Understanding how personal behaviors and environmental factors contribute to cancer outcomes is essential for both clinical and public health strategies. This project uses a dataset containing attributes like:

- *Patient demographics* (age, gender, country)
- *Lifestyle factors* (smoking, alcohol use, obesity)
- *Medical indicators* (genetic risk, air pollution)
- *Outcome variables* (cancer type, stage, treatment cost, survival, severity score)

The analysis was conducted in *Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)* and visualized using *Tableau* to allow non-technical users to interact with trends across cancer types and risk profiles.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- *Lung and Breast cancers* are the most prevalent in this sample.
- *Treatment costs* are highest for *Stage III & IV* cancers.
- *Males* show higher levels of *alcohol use* and *smoking*.
- *Genetic risk* and *air pollution* are strongly correlated with *severity score*.
- Treatment costs trend *inconsistently year-to-year*, indicating potential external cost drivers.
